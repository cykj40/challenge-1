Code Refactoring Assignment:
Fix page for Horiseon. 

Description: For this assignment I applied proper html semantic elemnets to the html code. I realized that how you define your html is how your page looks. Meaning that if you apply an incorrect tag it changes the format of the whole page. For example if you define the body as the header the header as the body you will have a funny looking page which doesnt function properly. So proper aplication of tags are neccesary for proper functionality of your web page. I also had to relink the css on the html page. Change the image in the css giving it a updated path and also reapply the relative path to the images.
